# POSITION SIZING (2% Rule)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Max Risk = Capital × 2%                    │
│  Risk/Share = Entry - Stoploss              │
│  Max Shares = Max Risk ÷ Risk/Share         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example (₹5L Capital):**
```
Max Risk: ₹10,000
Entry: ₹600 | SL: ₹550
Risk/Share: ₹50
Max Shares: 200
Position: ₹1,20,000
```
